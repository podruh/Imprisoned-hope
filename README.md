# Imprisoned-hope
Imprisoned Hope is school project and "prison break"-type game by two Czech students.

##Story

The story is based in near future, where are superpowers becoming real thing. That scares people.
So scientist developed many ways how to capture these powered people.
And one of the captured people, are you my friend.

##About Game, Technical Stuff

Game is written in C# and it is using XNA Framework via [MonoGame 3.4] (http://www.monogame.net/). Many textures are made by us, but of course we wouldn't able
to achieve this result withnout 3rd party teextures and mainly the sounds. Oh, the music.

~~Because  of the XNA Framework, we're able to provide the game only on windows machnies. And what more, you have to install (if you haven't already) these frameworks:~~

##Future development? Sure!

We really liked to work on this project, so we will try to expand our game by some guards with our own AI and of course, by new and better looking textures. But we also have lives to live so it will surely take some time to regenerate.
